# Dev Shop Sprint Planning Meeting

Sprint planning meetings are to be held on the first day of each sprint.

You will utilize Trello to track the progress of your sprint goals.


Sprint Length: `2 Weeks`


1. Establish the goals for the sprint. 

    - What modules to have completed?

    - What labs/projects are to be completed in a sprint?

    - What user stories align with the established goals?

    - What user stories can be completed in a sprint?



2. Create a sprint backlog of the tasks to be completed during the sprint. Add time estimates to each task. Each Treehouse course has the amount of time it will take to complete. Use those amounts as guidelines.

Use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/rkGHsOBW/devshop-sprint-planning-template) to create a board from our template to begin your sprint planning.

- **Create an account if needed.**


- Modules to be completed

- Labs

- Projects

- User Stories to be completed

> Each task needs to encompass each part of the definition of `"done"`.

> Example: To mark a module `"done"`, all videos, code challenges, and quizzes must be completed to earn a badge. 

3. You will need to submit the URL of your Trello board to the supervisor. Click [here](https://forms.gle/eeTTMyhjZKCHwTgeA) to submit your URL.

4. Each day, move cards from the `Backlog` to  `To Do Today`. As you complete modules, check them off. When a course is complete, move the card to the `Done` board.
