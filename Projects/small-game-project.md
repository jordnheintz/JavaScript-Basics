## The Requirements

In your first sprint, you will learn JavaScript basics, including Numbers, Arrays, Functions, and Loops. As you work through the courses and modules, you will apply that knowledge to your game. 

You code must include the following:

- Functions
- Loops  
- Arrays

The game needs to be coded to run in the Console. No HTML or CSS is needed for the project.

As we continue through JavaScript, you will learn how to transform your game with HTML and CSS.
